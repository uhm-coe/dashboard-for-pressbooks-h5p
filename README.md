# Pressbooks H5P Dashboard

* WordPress plugin: [https://wordpress.org/plugins/pressbooks-h5p-dashboard/](https://wordpress.org/plugins/pressbooks-h5p-dashboard/)
* Changelog: [https://wordpress.org/plugins/pressbooks-h5p-dashboard/#developers](https://wordpress.org/plugins/pressbooks-h5p-dashboard/#developers)

## Requirements

* [Pressbooks](https://docs.pressbooks.org/installation/)
* [H5P](https://wordpress.org/plugins/h5p/)

## Features

* **Dashboard Widget**: a new dashboard widget for instructors showing student progress. Progress can be shown by user and by chapter, and filtered by user role and a range of dates of user registration or last login. Note: last logins are tracked once this plugin is enabled, so there will be no last login times saved from before plugin activation.
* **Chapter Badges** in *Table of Contents*: a new badge appears next to chapters with embedded H5P content in the *Table of Contents*. For anonymous users, the badge shows the total number of H5P embeds in the Chapter. For logged in users, the badge shows the number of incomplete H5P embeds, or a checkmark if they are all complete. Hovering over the badge reveals a tooltip with details on each H5P embed.
* **Chapter Badges** in *Dashboard > Organize*: a new column, H5P Content, appears in the *Pressbooks Organize* dashboard showing which chapters have embedded H5P content.
* **Hide H5P Content For Anonymous Users**: a new option (shown below) to prevent anonymous users from seeing H5P Content. Use this to encourage users to log in so their results can be stored.
