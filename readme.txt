*Dashboard for Pressbooks and H5P* requires the following WordPress plugins installed:

* [Pressbooks](https://docs.pressbooks.org/installation/)
* [H5P](https://wordpress.org/plugins/h5p/)

*Dashboard for Pressbooks and H5P* provides the following features:

* **Dashboard Widget**: a new dashboard widget for instructors showing student progress. Progress can be shown by user and by chapter, and filtered by user role and a range of dates of user registration or last login. Note: last logins are tracked once this plugin is enabled, so there will be no last login times saved from before plugin activation.
* **Chapter Badges** in *Table of Contents*: a new badge appears next to chapters with embedded H5P content in the *Table of Contents*. For anonymous users, the badge shows the total number of H5P embeds in the Chapter. For logged in users, the badge shows the number of incomplete H5P embeds, or a checkmark if they are all complete. Hovering over the badge reveals a tooltip with details on each H5P embed.
* **Chapter Badges** in *Dashboard > Organize*: a new column, H5P Content, appears in the *Pressbooks Organize* dashboard showing which chapters have embedded H5P content.
* **Hide H5P Content For Anonymous Users**: a new option (shown below) to prevent anonymous users from seeing H5P Content. Use this to encourage users to log in so their results can be stored.

This project was funded by the *Hubert V. Everly Endowed Scholar* fund and the College of Education at the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa.
